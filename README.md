# babylon
My first babylonjs demo



npm install

npm run start



With babylonjs, babylonjs-loaders, pepjs,


What i've done:
	preview 3D demo with gltf, and print texture on it.

todo

1.No support for old browser which not support Window.PointerEvent, so 
  fix it by calculating camera.position when doing touchmove.

2.Drag mesh and change all meshes in position where need to be.

3.Customizer: canvas to 3D immediately.
